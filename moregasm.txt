Moregasm is a language for training a neural network with text.

A moregasm script is a list of rules.  The simplest kind of rule
is two lists of words separated by "->", for example

	hello how are you -> hi i am fine
	goodbye -> bye

A special word is "*" which is substituted with a random word
during training, giving it the effect of a wildcard:

	* is for dinner -> yum

The first clause of the rule can be a comma-separated list,
representing the conversational thread:

	whats your name, * whats yours -> bob
	* whats yours -> whats my what

A rule can be prefixed by a list of tags and a ":".  Tags can
be used to represent different actors or properties, for example:

	bob: whats your name, * whats yours -> bob
	sam: whats your name, * whats yours -> sam
	bob: whos your best friend -> sam
	sam: whos your best friend -> bob

A rule can be weighted by appending "x" and a number to the arrow.
This causes it to be entered into the training bag that many times.
Example:

	* ->x4 i dont understand

Comments are marked by "#".

That's all there is to the language.  A moregasm script is a list of
rules.  Each rule is compiled to shibboleths.  The positions of the
wildcards within the clauses are also included, allowing substitutions
to be performed.  The generator is then trained from the compiled
moregasm code.
